# Machine Learning-Based Voltage and Frequency Control for Energy-Efficient GPU Computing

This repository contains all code, scripts, models, benchmarks, and results used in our project, based on predictive DVFS modeling for GPU power optimization using machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `kernels/`: CUDA compute and memory benchmarks
- `gpowerSAMPLER/`: Power sampling tool for NVIDIA GPUs
- `data_collection/`: Scripts to collect power, performance, and frequency data
- `datasets/`: Raw and processed data for ML model training
- `models/`: ML training code and saved models
- `deployment/`: Real-time ML-based DVFS controller
- `experiments/`: Plots, logs, and result summaries
- `paper/`: IEEE-format LaTeX paper and references
- `docs/`: PhD thesis and supporting documentation
